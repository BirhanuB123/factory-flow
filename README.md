# Welcome to our ERP

## Phase 1 — Inventory ledger & production completion

- **Stock movements**: Every stock change writes a `StockMovement` row and updates `Product.stock` (opening balance, receipt, issue, adjustment, production consume/output).
- **API**: `GET/POST /api/inventory/movements` (authenticated). Product create/edit adjusts stock via the ledger.
- **BOMs** must define **`outputProduct`** (finished-good SKU) and optional **`effectiveFrom` / `effectiveTo`** before a job can be completed.
- **Completing a job** (`status: Completed`): consumes BOM components × job quantity and adds **job quantity** to the output product. Runs once per job (`inventoryPosted`).
- **Reseed DB** (adds FG SKUs + BOM output links + opening-balance movements):

```bash
cd backend && node seeder.js
```

MongoDB **replica set** is optional: on a standalone dev instance, production completion uses a sequential path with rollback on failure.

## Phase 2 — Demand → supply

- **`GET /api/mrp/suggestions`** — Open orders (pending/processing) × BOM lines: ATP, reserved FG per line, job coverage, **suggested make** qty.
- **`POST /api/orders/:orderId/reserve-line`** — Reserve finished good from stock for a line (caps at line qty & available ATP).
- **`POST /api/production/from-order`** — Create a job linked to `order.items[lineIndex].productionJob`; BOM output must match the line SKU.
- **`POST /api/production/:id/reserve-materials`** — Reserve BOM components × job qty (ATP for raw drops for other users).
- **`GET /api/inventory/alerts`** — SKUs where **ATP** (on hand − active reservations) ≤ **reorderPoint** (critical / high / low).
- **`GET/DELETE /api/inventory/reservations`** — List or release a single reservation.
- Delivering or **cancelling** an order **releases** all FG reservations for that order. Cancelling/deleting a job **releases** material reservations.

## Phase 3 — Procurement, finance, access control

- **Purchase orders**: `draft` → **approve** → **receive** (partial OK). Receiving posts **`receipt`** movements tied to `PurchaseOrder` and updates `unitCost` / `lastReceived` when line has unit cost.
- **API**: `GET/POST /api/purchase-orders`, `PUT :id`, `POST :id/approve`, `POST :id/receive`, `POST :id/cancel`.
- **Invoice from order**: `POST /api/finance/invoices/from-order` `{ orderId, dueDate? }` — links `Invoice.order`; one invoice per order.
- **AR aging**: `GET /api/finance/ar-aging` — buckets (not due, 1–30, …, 90+), marks past-due **Pending** as **Overdue**.
- **Permissions** (`backend/config/permissions.js`): **purchasing_head** (PO create/approve/receive/cancel), **warehouse_head** (receive PO, manual inventory post), **finance_head** (unchanged finance routes). **employee**: view PO only; **manual stock movement** = Admin + warehouse only.
- **Auth**: login/`GET /me` return `permissions[]`; `GET /api/auth/permissions` returns matrix doc for **Settings → Access**.
- Reseed adds **buyer@integracnc.com** & **warehouse@integracnc.com** (password123).

## Phase 4 — Hardening, ops, tests, docs

- **Frontend API URL**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (see `frontend/.env.example`). Defaults to `http://localhost:5000/api`.
- **Backend env**: copy `backend/env.example` → `.env`. In **production**, `JWT_SECRET` must be ≥32 chars or the server exits. Structured logs (**pino**), **Helmet**, **rate limits** (login + API), JSON body cap.
- **Validation**: login + manual stock movements use **express-validator**.
- **Audit** (optional): `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true` logs product/BOM changes and manual stock movements to `auditlogs`.
- **Tests** (needs MongoDB): `cd backend && npm test` — uses DB `factory_flow_test` or `MONGODB_TEST_URI`. Covers receipt → stock and **job completion → BOM consume / FG output**.
- **Docs**: `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (HTTPS/proxy), `docs/BACKUPS_AND_RESTORE.md`, `docs/ORDER_TO_SHIP_USER_GUIDE.md`.
